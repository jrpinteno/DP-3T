# Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing

This repository contains my own translation to Catalan and Spanish of the engagement comic made by [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/) to explain how DP-3T works to a wider audience.

The original comic, licensed CC-0, can be found in https://ncase.me/contact-tracing/ and is also [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ncase/ncase.github.io)

You can find more information about this protocol in the official repository of the [DP-3T project](https://github.com/DP-3T/documents). Amongst other resources it contains the original comic as well as translations to different languages.
